# Hi, I'm Jason 👋

**Senior Data Scientist / Strategic Analytic Actuary (FIAA)**

> 12+ years transforming complex data into actionable insights for the insurance and financial services sectors.

## 🔬 The research, first

**[Life Insurance Experience Bench](https://github.com/jasonzheshiou/Life_Insurance_Experience_Bench)** —
47 sealed synthetic portfolios (250 000 policies each, Death / CI / TPD / IP), two Qwen 27B models crossed with
two harnesses, scored strict on a held-out split with false alarms counted.

| measured | result |
|---|---|
| strict accuracy (best cell) | **71.2 %** — 79 hits / 111 units |
| false alarms when it spoke | **41.9 %** (precision 58.1 %) |
| does a harness transfer between models? | **no** — cross-loading cost 0.9 accuracy, 1.2 precision points |
| tuning split → unseen books | **−32.1 / −28.6 points** for the two models |
| cost of the same exam | 0.89 M tokens / 5.9 h vs **1.95 M / 21.9 h** |

Data comes from [Synthetic_Life_Insurance_Data_Generator](https://github.com/jasonzheshiou/Synthetic_Life_Insurance_Data_Generator)
(deterministic, seed 42, planted controls on actuals only). Findings and provenance:
<https://jasonzheshiou.github.io/research/findings.html>.

## 📐 The second study: output variance

**[Multi-Agents_Underwriter](https://github.com/jasonzheshiou/Multi-Agents_Underwriter)** — the same applicant run
through the LLM decision path ~100 times, with Wilson 95 % intervals on every proportion. Measured on
Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (local, temperature 0.1); synthetic applicants, no ground truth, so this measures **consistency,
not accuracy**.

| measured | result |
|---|---|
| deterministic rule path | **0 %** variance across 600 runs |
| LLM path, clear → borderline cases | **0 % → 26 % → 42 %** (widest evidence path 47 %) |
| temperature 0.1 → 0.0 | changed the **decision** (decline 58 % / loading 42 % → flat loading) |
| debate + most-conservative combine | **100/100** identical, absorbing a ~20 % agent variance |

## 🛠 How the work actually gets done

Built in broken time between a full-time job and childcare, which forced a method:

- **Agent-loop execution** — delegate the loop, not the line: a written contract, an execution surface, an artefact
  trail and a stopping rule. The underwriter's application code was written by the local model it studies; the
  benchmark's harness was built by an agent on a third model, so no model tuned the exam it sat.
- **Black-box behavioural verification** — one hypothesis, one edit, re-check the neighbours, keep or revert,
  snapshot the bytes. Held-out results never feed tuning. Steering happens outside the model: prompts, harness,
  rules, combine rules, sampling settings, tool surface.
- **Asynchronous human-in-the-loop** — write the handoff document, launch the unattended run, leave, get pinged when
  the shared server frees up, return as the supervisor and validation checkpoint. Resume is the default
  (`--skip-existing`, `flock`, one status line).

## About Me

I'm a **Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia (FIAA)** with deep experience in regulated environments. My expertise spans machine learning in production, predictive underwriting, data integration, business intelligence, and process automation.

I thrive at the intersection of **technical depth** and **executive communication** - turning complex datasets into clear, strategic insights that drive measurable business outcomes.

Beyond the day job, I'm passionate about **AI cooperation** - building tools where humans and models work together, not in competition. I believe the best systems don't replace people; they amplify them. I'm actively exploring how AI can augment analytical workflows, improve data governance, and help teams make better decisions, faster.
